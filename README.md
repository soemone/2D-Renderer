This is a project to explore wgpu and cure my obsession with simulations, especially realtime simulations of gravity

## Objectives:
 - To make a bare-bones 2D renderer
 - To simulate gravity with the renderer

*This is not a rendering engine to create an application unrelated to any of the objectives*
